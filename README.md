# Laptop Price Analysis & Data Cleaning 💻

### Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a raw dataset of laptop prices using **Python** and **Pandas**. The goal was to transform messy data (unstructured text) into a structured format to derive business insights.

### Key Features & Skills Used
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types (e.g., converting '8GB' RAM to integer 8).
- **Python Libraries:** Used `Pandas` for manipulation and `Seaborn` for visualization.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Created a correlation matrix to identify how RAM and Weight impact the Price.
- **Automation:** The script automatically cleans raw data and exports a ready-to-use CSV file.

### Key Insights
- **Price vs RAM:** Strong positive correlation observed; higher RAM significantly impacts pricing.
- **Brand Analysis:** Analyzed average pricing across different brands to identify premium vs. budget options.
